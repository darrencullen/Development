The assignment gave a good introduction to programming for the iPad and in particular the controls that aren't present for the iPhone (popover, splitview). 

I achieved most of the tasks but didn't create the graph view programatically. I migrated the calc view to the iPad storyboard and created a popover in the style with the arrow pointing to the button that has called it. I implemented the 3 gestures and also saved the graph origin and scale state. 

I looked into storing the orientation using [UIDevice currentDevice] orientation], but decided against it as the app should really display in the orientation that it is currently loaded in.
